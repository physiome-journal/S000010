    Reproducibility study of the Fabbri et al. 2017 model of the human sinus
    node action potential
  description: >-
    The sinoatrial node (SAN) is the natural pacemaker of the mammalian heart.
    It has been the subject of several mathematical studies, aimed at
    reproducing its electrical response under normal sinus rhythms, as well as
    under various conditions.
